This is a repository for a Web Application called Arkeyo.
Developed as part of FLL - UnEarthed Theme 2025.
This is our Innovation Project.
. The Main problem we are trying to solve is to get more people interested in the Archaeology Space.
. We Believe that if we have more people interested then there will be more funding, which then gets better research and better tools. Which will help this space more
and help solve various problems that we see currently.
